# Google foobar challenge

## What is this?

According to many sources, this is a hidden recruitment procedure by Google. It comprises of 9 coding problems, separated into 5 different levels, each of which has 1/2/3/2/1 problems, respectively (and of course the difficulty increases with level). The candidate selection is random, so I'm not sure how I got in (I literally just googled some ML papers at that moment for reading and got invited, so you could try doing it). However, candidate who is already in the selection pool can invite other people to join. The prerequisite is that you need to pass level 2 and 5 of the selection tests (I have 2 invitations, one has been used for my friends, the other has not been used since I have no friends :sadge:).

When you were in the test environment, it will resemble a Linux terminal with some commands allowed:

- `cd` for navigation
- `ls` for listing file contents
- `request` for requesting new problems to solve
- `edit` for editing solution file
- `verify` for testing solution against google test cases
- `submit` for submitting solutions
- `status` for checking how many problems you've solved (as well as some other stuffs like invitation links)

In this challenge, you ARE ALLOWED to use Google to search for hints to solve the problems (and heck, even you can search for the solution to the problem itself, and I recommended it since some of the problems is so damn hard, and some problems are just mere torture. But you need to understand the solution or else you won't be solving anything), so take this chance as an opportunity to learn coding problems (you think Google will hire you just by solving this problems? Ain't no way).
